# 18/27-html-to-pdf

This project is focused on creating a tool that can convert HTML into PDF
documents.

This will be a full stack project, will build frontend as well as api which can
be used independently. I will use [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) to
initiate the project and will use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and for
styling [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with
[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). also will use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
